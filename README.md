# Recommender systems using python
Recommender systems in python using the MovieLes Dataset



## 1) Item based collaborative filtering

In this folder, there is a simple recommender system built with python. In collaborative filtering, the behavior of a group of users is used to make recommendations to other users. In this case, item-based collaborative filtering is used. This case identifies similar items based on users’ previous ratings.

This item based collaborative filtering is based on matrix factorization. The Pearson correlation coefficient is used to determine the correlation between the users' ratings of two movies. This number will lie between -1 and 1. 1 indicates a positive linear correlation, -1 indicates a negative correlation and 0 indicates no linear correlation. 


## 2) Content based

Content based systems use meta data such as genre, producer, actor, musician to recommend items say movies or music. Content based systems are based on the idea that if you liked a certain item you are most likely to like something that is similar to it.
